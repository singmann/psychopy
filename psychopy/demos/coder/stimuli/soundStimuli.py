"""
For sound use, I really recommend installing pygame (v1.8 or later). 
For users of the intel-Mac app bundle you already have it. Pyglet will
play sounds, but I find them unpredictable in timing and (sometimes they
don't seem to play at all. :-(

PsychoPy sound handling with pygame is not ideal, with a latency of 20-30ms, but at least with pygame it is robust - 
all sounds play consistently. I hope one day to write a better, low-level handler for playing sounds directly from the
drivers (e.g. CoreAudio, DirectSound, ASIO), but for now, pygame will have to do.
