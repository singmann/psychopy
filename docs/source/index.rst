PsychoPy is an open-source application to allow the presentation of stimuli and collection of data for a wide range of neuroscience, psychology and psychophysics experiments. It's a free, powerful alternative to Presentation |TM| or e-Prime |TM|, written in Python (a free alternative to Matlab |TM| ).

News
====================

**Latest stable version**: 1.77.02 was released July 2013, with several performance improvements. See complete :doc:`changelog`

**Cutting edge version**: 1.78.00 was released Aug 2013. Adds 'Static Component' to allow pre-loading of images, and Shape Component for standard geometric shapes

**Upcoming Workshops**:
    
    * Jon Peirce is running a 1/2-day `PsychoPy workshop at ECVP <http://www.ecvp.uni-bremen.de/node/46>`_
    
    * We'll be running a multi-day :ref:`Python for Neuroscience workshop <P4N>` again in April 2014 at Nottingham University. I'm hoping we'll be able to run Novice and Intermediate streams this year (last year was novice-only), with contributing experienced users from all over the world (last year was just Jon)
