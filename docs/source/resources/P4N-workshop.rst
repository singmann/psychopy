P4N: Python for Neuroscience (and Psychology)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Do you want to get started using Python_ (and PsychoPy_) for your studies in behavioural sciences? Maybe you keep meaning to switch from another package and haven't gotten around to it. This workshop will get you off the ground with building and analysing your experiments using Python.

Details (all to be confirmed):

    :Spaces: 30
    :When: 30 April - 2nd May (inclusive)
    :Where: School of Psychology, University of Nottingham
    :Cost: Â£300
    :Includes: Refreshments and lunch. Accommodation is not included but can be booked cheaply via the University Accommodation Office (details to follow)
    :Target audience: Novice    
    :Content:
        Material will cover *Python* programming basics as well as PsychoPy-specific coding

`Python`_ is a powerful well-designed programming language that's totally free and runs on all operating systems. It's a little like a free replacement for Matlab, but with more flexibility and better syntax!

`PsychoPy`_ is a modern, powerful, easy-to-use software package for conducting studies in psychophysics, neuroimaging and experimental psychology. It's become the package of choice in very many labs worldwide (see `PsychoPy usage stats <http://www.psychopy.org/usage.php>`_). It comes with a graphical interface (Builder) as well as a `Python` scripting interface (Coder), which will be the primary focus here.

This course will get you started with:

    - basic `Python` programming (with exercises for non-programmers and for convertees from Matlab)
    - running experiments in `PsychoPy` using code
    - building your own extensions to `PsychoPy`
    - analysing and plotting your data

The workshop will include a mixture of demonstrations, self-paced exercises and time for users to create their own experiment in the software.
