P4N: Python for Neuroscience (and Psychology)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     
Do you want to get started using Python_ (and PsychoPy_) for your studies in behavioural sciences? Maybe you keep meaning to switch from another package and haven't gotten around to it. This workshop will get you off the ground with building and analysing your experiments using Python.

There will be a limit of 30 places, so book yours now at the `Nottingham online shop <http://store.nottingham.ac.uk/browse/extra_info.asp?compid=1&modid=2&prodid=199&deptid=9&catid=49>`_ (requires you to set up an account, but we won't be sending you spam!)

:Content:
    Material will cover *Python* programming basics as well as PsychoPy-specific coding
:Teacher:
    Jon Peirce, creator of *PsychoPy*

*Python* is a powerful well-designed programming language that's totally free and runs on all operating systems. It's a little like a free replacement for Matlab, but with more flexibility and better syntax!

*PsychoPy* is a modern, powerful, easy-to-use software package for conducting studies in psychophysics, neuroimaging and experimental psychology. It's become the package of choice in very many labs worldwide (see `usage statistics <http://www.psychopy.org/usage.php>`_). It comes with a graphical interface (Builder) as well as a Python scripting interface (Coder), which will be the primary focus here.

This course will get you started with:

    - basic *Python* programming (with exercises for non-programmers and for convertees from Matlab)
    - running experiments in *PsychoPy* using code
    - building your own extensions to *PsychoPy*
    - analysing and plotting your data

The workshop will include a mixture of demonstrations, self-paced exercises and periods of users creating their own experiment in the software.
